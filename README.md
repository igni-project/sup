## 1. Introduction

The Scene Update Protocol (SUP) is an application layer communication protocol capable of transferring real-time 3D graphics over a network. Its use of actions and model file loading grants it great extendability and versatility while remaining lightweight and simple in design.

## 2. Definitions and Abbreviations

**3D**
3-dimensional

**field**
variable in a data structure

**float**
IEEE 754 floating-point integer

**ID**
unique identifier

**int**
signed integer

**uint**
unsigned integer

## 3. Data Formats

### 3.1. String

The term ‘string’ in this document specifically refers to a null-terminated string in UTF8 (RFC [3629](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629)) format.

### 3.2. File Path

The term ‘file path’ in this document specifically refers to a string that points to a file. Format of file paths may vary implementation to implementation.

### 3.3. URL

The term 'URL' is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. URLs shall be interpreted in accordance with the URL Standard by WHATWG ([link](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/)).

## 4. Requests

The term 'request' in this specification is defined as a message sent from a client to a server. Requests contain instructions, which when read by a server, are carried out by the server on the clients behalf.

### 4.1. Request Header

| **Size (bytes)**| **Value**   | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 8-bit int   | Request code    |

Every request has its contents preceded by a header. The header has 1 field: an 8-bit code that identifies the request placed after the header.

### 4.2. Configure Connection

| **Size (bytes)**| **Value**   | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 0           | Opcode          |
| 4               | 0           | Version ID      |

The ‘Configure Connection’ request provides a server with details on the connection of the client that sent the message. 

This request is comprised of 1 field: the version of protocol adhered to by the sender. To inform the server that version 1.0 of the SUP protocol is in use, this field shall be set to 0.

#### Errors

The ‘Configure Connection’ request shall fail if:

**Invalid protocol version**
-   **Version ID** does not identify an existing version of the SUP protocol.

### 4.3. Import Model

| **Size (bytes)**| **Value**         | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 1                 | Opcode          |
| 4               | 32-bit int        | Model ID        |
| 1+              | File path or URL  | Model path      |

The ‘Import Model’ request shall instruct the server to import a model from a file. If the file specified by **Model path** is a shortcut, then the file loaded shall be that which the shortcut or chain of shortcuts point to. Files of the same base name as **Model path** shall be imported and bound to the loaded model automatically.

The model created by the request must have the same ID number as **Model ID**. Upon creation, the model shall be hidden. Its initial location and rotation coordinates shall be 0 on all axes. Scale, however shall start out at 1 on model load.

This request consists of 2 fields. The first field is 32-bit identification code of the newly created model. The second field directly follows the first and is the model path as a null-terminated UTF-8 string.

#### Errors

The ‘Import Model’ request shall fail if:

**File import failed**
-   The server fails to import the model file.

**ID already taken**
-   A model of ID **Model ID** already exists in the clients scene.

### 4.4. Show Model

| **Size (bytes)**| **Value**   | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 2           | Opcode          |
| 4               | 32-bit int  | Model ID        |

The ‘Show Model’ request shall make the model specified by **Model ID** visible to the viewer.

#### Errors
The ‘Show Model’ request shall fail if:

**Model not found**
-   **Model ID** does not match the ID of any model in the clients scene.

| 4               | 32-bit int  | Model ID        |

This request shall hide the model identified by **Model ID**. A model which is hidden shall not be displayed onscreen.

#### Errors
The ‘Hide Model’ request shall fail if:

**Model not found**
-   **Model ID** does not match the ID of any model in the clients scene.

### 4.6. Transform Model

| **Size (bytes)**| **Value**   | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 4           | Opcode          |

| 4               | float       | Z scale         |

The ‘Transform Model’ request shall set the location, rotation and scale of the model referenced by **Model ID**. The X, Y and Z location, rotation and scale coordinates of the selected model are to be copied from the request.
